AAITS - Arduino-Android Integrated Telemonitoring System
===


The project is divided into 3 independent parts, which can be used in conjunction or as stand-alone applicaitons, provided that the communication protocol is respected. These are:
* Sensor nodes: Arduino-based devices that take measurements from the environment.
* Server: The server stores and processes the data sent from the motes and makes it available for users to visualize an download
* Smartphone: An android app creates a simple interface for configuring and interfacing with the sensor nodes. This is particulary useful when the motes are located in isolated areas with no possibility for a direct data link, or whent the cost of such link is prohibitive.
